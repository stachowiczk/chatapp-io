## Chat

This is my take on a real-time messaging app, built using the MERN stack with socket.io
Current features include messaging and a contacts list with users' online status shown as a dot.
User authentication is stateless and handled with JWTs. 

Planned features include better handling of contacts, such as the ability to block users, group chats and end-to-end message encryption.

A live version is underway
